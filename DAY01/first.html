<!-- Question differnce between SCRIPT tage in head, body and in the head but with async and defer  -->

<!-- 
The placement of the <script> tag in an HTML document affects how and when JavaScript is loaded and executed. Here's the difference between placing the <script> tag in the <head>, the <body>, and using the async or defer attributes:

Placing <script> in <head>
The script is loaded and executed before the HTML content is rendered.
This can block page rendering and delay the display of content, making the page load slower.
Useful if the script must run before the page is visible.


Placing <script> in <body> (usually just before </body>)
The HTML is loaded and rendered first, and then the script runs.
This ensures that the page content appears quickly while JavaScript loads later.
Common practice for improving page load speed.

Placing <script> in <head> with async
The script is fetched and executed asynchronously while the rest of the page continues to load.
Execution timing is unpredictable; scripts load independently and may execute out of order.
Ideal for loading external scripts that donâ€™t depend on other scripts.

Placing <script> in <head> with defer
The script is fetched while the page loads but executes only after the HTML is fully loaded.
Scripts maintain their order of execution.
Best for running scripts after the document is completely parsed, avoiding render-blocking.
